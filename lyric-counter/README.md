## Getting Started

This react app uses node as the package manager so the first step to run would be to install this if this is not already installed on your system, link here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Make sure to cd into lyric-counter, in the project directory run:

### `npm install`

to install relevant dependencies, then:

### `npm start`

this should automatically direct you to show the app in a browser, and it should run on http://localhost:3000 as standard but please check the command line in case it is different, thank you.
